# reverseArray

## Feature Tasks
* Write a function called `insertShiftArray` which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Stretch Goal - **NOT COMPLETED**
Once youâ€™ve achieved a working solution, write a second function that removes an element from the middle index and shifts other elements in the array to fill the new gap.
