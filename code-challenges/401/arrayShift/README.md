# reverseArray

## Feature Tasks
* Write a function called `reverseArray` which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Stretch Goal
Once you’ve achieved a working solution, implement the same feature with a different methodology. (Hint: what different techniques do you have when working with arrays? Recursion, loops, indexes, modifying the array input directly…)
