## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
* Write a function called `BinarySearch` which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the array’s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

### Stretch Goal - **NOT COMPLETED**
Once you’ve achieved a working solution, benchmark with varying array sizes (100, 10000, 100000 elements)
